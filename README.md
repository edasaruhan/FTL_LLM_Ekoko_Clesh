## First Assignment

### Q1: Fine-Tuning and Hugging Face Model Training

In this section, we explore fine-tuning pre-trained models using **Hugging Face Transformers**. The process includes:
- Loading pre-trained models.
- Fine-tuning the models on custom datasets.
- Evaluating model performance.

You can find the detailed reports and scripts in the respective subfolders.

### Q2: Further Exploration of Fine-Tuning Techniques

This section builds upon the previous question (Q1), diving deeper into model fine-tuning and comparison. Scripts and the final report are included in this directory.

## Second Assignment

### Q1: Application Development

For this task, we developed a Python application related to the fine-tuning of models or data processing. The Python script (`app.py`) and the evaluation report can be found under the `SECOND ASSIGNMENT/Q1` folder.

### Q2: Comparison of Text Embeddings

This task involves the comparison of three different types of text embeddings: **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **BERT**. We analyze their performance on a text classification task using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**. The comparison is documented in the `Embedding_Comparison_Report.pdf`.

You can run the Python script `comparison.py` to reproduce the comparison.
